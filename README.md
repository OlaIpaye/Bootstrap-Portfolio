# Bootstrap-Portfolio

Creating a portfolio website using Bootstrap.

## User Story

Using Bootstrap, recreate your portfolio site with the following items:

- A navigation bar.

* A navigation menu at the top. Feel free to use the navbar code provided in Bootstrap's documentation, or create your own navbar by applying the correct Bootstrap classes to your HTML.
* Include links that are applicable to your portfolio.
* Links should navigate to the appropriate sections.
* A hero section: A jumbotron featuring your picture, your name, and any other information you'd like to include.
* A work section:

1. A section displaying your work in grid.
2. If you need to use placeholder image use placehold.co
3. Use Bootstrap cards for each project.
4. The description should give a brief overview of the work.
5. Each project will eventually link to your class project work!

- A skills section:

1. List out the skills you expect to learn from the bootcamp.

- An about/contact section:

1. An About Me section in the same row.

- A footer section:

1. All hyperlinks should have a hover effect.
2. All buttons should display a box shadow upon hover.

- Your Bootstrap solution should minimize use of media queries.

* Deploy your new Bootstrap-powered portfolio to GitHub Pages.
